# Pig Card Game

## Description
My version of Pig Card Game

Game Rules:
    The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
    In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they whish. Each result get added to their current score
    But, if the player rolls a 1, all their current score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
    The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their current score gets added to their global score.
    After that, it's the next player's turn. The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins.
